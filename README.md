Here is the organized and improved README.md content for the Blulytix.ai Document Assistant project:

# Blulytix.ai Document Assistant

## Introduction

The Blulytix.ai Document Assistant is a Streamlit application designed to interact with PDF documents using advanced language models. This application allows users to ask questions about the content of a PDF document and receive detailed responses. The project leverages various libraries and tools for document loading, text splitting, vector database creation, and language model interaction.

## Features

- **PDF Document Ingestion**: Load and process PDF documents.
- **Text Splitting**: Split documents into smaller chunks for efficient processing.
- **Vector Database**: Create and load a vector database for document retrieval.
- **Language Model Interaction**: Use advanced language models to answer user queries.
- **Streamlit Interface**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the document assistant.

## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Run the Application

```sh
streamlit run poland.py
```

### Interact with the Application

1. Open the Streamlit interface in your browser.
2. Enter your question in the text input field.
3. View the response generated by the language model.

## Project Structure

- `poland.py`: Main application script.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required packages.
- `data/poland.pdf`: Sample PDF document used for demonstration.

## Methodology

1. **Load Libraries**: Import necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling.
2. **Configure Logging**: Set up logging based on the environment variable DEBUG_MODE.
3. **Define Constants**: Set constants for document path, model name, embedding model, vector store name, and persistence directory.
4. **Ingest PDF**: Load the PDF document if it exists, otherwise log an error and display a message in Streamlit.
5. **Split Documents**: Split the loaded documents into smaller chunks for easier processing.
6. **Load or Create Vector Database**: Load the vector database from disk if it exists, otherwise create a new one.
7. **Create Retriever with Caching**: Create a retriever with caching to improve performance.
8. **Create Chain**: Create a chain with the retriever and language model, preserving the syntax.
9. **Main Function**: Set up the Streamlit interface, handle user input, process the question using the created chain, and display the response or handle errors appropriately.

## Code Overview

### Main Functions

- `ingest_pdf(doc_path)`: Load PDF documents.
- `split_documents(documents)`: Split documents into smaller chunks.
- `load_vector_db()`: Load or create the vector database.
- `create_retriever_cached(vector_db)`: Create a retriever with caching.
- `create_chain(retriever, llm)`: Create a chain with the retriever and language model.
- `main()`: Main function to set up the Streamlit interface and handle user interactions.
